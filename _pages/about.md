My Grandma, Merla, was a painter and her mom, Dora (my Meme), was a crafter.  My sister and I spent a lot of time between Grandma and Meme's houses growing up while our parents dealt with an unpleasant divorce. 
At Grandma's we had our own art boxes loaded with everything we needed to draw and paint with while we learned. Oil pastels, charcoal, leads, colored pencils and yes, we had crayons too. She was a seamstress and we also learned to sew! Later in life she did jewelry making with pieces she purchased in Arizona each winter on their snowbird travels.

At Meme's house we never knew what we'd get to learn. There was always an adventurous creative outlet waiting for us. We explored leather tooling, wood carving, mosaic, weaving, macramé, collaging, jewelry making, and just about any other craft you could imagine.
