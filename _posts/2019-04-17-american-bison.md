## First Gourd Class

My first gourd class was amazing! My good friend, Lisa Libby, invited me to a try a project on a different type of medium. I was hooked and in love at first gourd art!


This AMERICAN BISON gourd was done with woodburning the basic outline and then using a masking fluid to apply various alcohol ink colors to just the bison. We then did the pointillism technique to add the black/dark areas. I havenâ€™t finished this piece yet. Waiting to get more proficient in my woodburning skills.
